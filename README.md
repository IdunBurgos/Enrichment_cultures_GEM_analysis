Welcome!

Here you can find the code for building and analysing genome-scale metabolic models for the enrichment cultures studied in our project, Cell4Chem. 

The main code is separated into different folders:

0. Testing carveme bacterial universe:  Here the new carveme bacterial model was tested on the bacteria Clostridia BL-3 and BL-4, as well as for R. cellulolyticum.
1. Reconstructing GEMs from MAGs - The notebooks and code in this part describes the reconstruction process. It also includes the analysis of the models on an individiual basis
2. Enrichment cultures simulations  - Thse notebooks shows the community simulations and the analysis of the results.
