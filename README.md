Welcome!

Here you can find the code for building and analysing genome-scale metabolic models for the enrichment cultures studied in our project, Cell4Chem. 

The main code is separated into different folders:

0. Notebooks (not updated after cleaning up) - Here the new carveme bacterial model was tested on the bacteria Clostridia BL-3 and BL-4, as well as for R. cellulolyticum.
1. Notebooks (not updated after cleaning up) - The notebooks and code in this part describes the reconstruction process. It also includes the analysis of the models on an individiual basis
2. Notebooks (updated!) - This notebooks shows the community simulations and the analysis of the results. (NB: In Part 5.2.1. you can find the analysis of a test of stediercom version 0.1.3)

a. Notebooks (partly updated) - Code used to create files that are used throughout the project.
